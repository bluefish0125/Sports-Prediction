    "- **Base**: Basic game statistics such as points, rebounds, assists, etc.\n",
    "- **Advanced**: More complex metrics that may include efficiency ratings, true shooting percentage, player impact estimate, etc.\n",
    "- **Misc**: Miscellaneous statistics that don't fit neatly into the traditional or advanced categories. This could include things like points off turnovers, second chance points, bench points, etc.\n",
    "- **Four Factors**: A concept from Dean Oliver's \"Basketball on Paper\" book. These are four statistical categories that he identifies as key to basketball success: shooting (effective field goal percentage), turnovers (turnover rate), rebounding (rebound rate), and free throws (free throw rate).\n",
    "- **Scoring**: Statistics related to scoring, possibly detailing shooting efficiency from various parts of the court.\n",
    "- **Opponent**: Stats about the performance of opponents, potentially useful for assessing defensive effectiveness.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Metrics that indicate how involved a player or team is in various aspects of the game, like usage rate.\n",
    "- **Defense**: Detailed defensive metrics, possibly including opponent shooting percentages at different distances, blocks, steals, etc.\n",
