Things still needed to try:
- try scaling ranking data and unscaling ranking data
- try spliting the data into only home games

- try scaling the odds data
* this did not work. The odds data actually confused my estimations. Will exclude in future testings.

- try rolling no exponential with ranking data 
- try no exponential with ranking data and odds data all scaled
